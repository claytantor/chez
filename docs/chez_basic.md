Chez Basic
================================
Chez is a game system based on chess. It is intended to be the most print friendly printable chess set in the world.

The King
-------------------------
The king can move exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Only once per player, per game.

The Rook
-------------------------
The rook moves any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. It also is moved while castling.

The Bishop
-------------------------
The bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.

The Queen
-------------------------
The queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.

The Knight
-------------------------
The knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. In other words, the knight moves two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or one square horizontally then two squares vertically. Its move is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.

Pawns
-------------------------
Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
A pawn can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, each pawn has the option of moving two squares forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn cannot move backwards.

Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in front of them) but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant.
